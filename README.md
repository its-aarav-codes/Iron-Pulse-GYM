# Iron Pulse Gym – Landing Page Website

This project is a fully responsive landing page website built for a modern gym or fitness center.  
The goal was simple: create a clean, fast, and conversion-focused website that works smoothly on mobile, tablet, and desktop without relying on any backend.

This project is part of my portfolio and reflects how I approach real-world frontend development.

It focuses on:

No unnecessary complexity, just a solid user experience.

Many small businesses don’t need complex dashboards or heavy frameworks.  
They need a website that:

This project reflects that mindset.

## 📦 Project Status

This is a **frontend-only project**.  
Backend features like form submissions or payments can be added later if required.
To Keep It Minimal i have not added any images in the background of the hero section but to use this template you can download the folder and add an image in it.
